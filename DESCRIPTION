Description: Contains the development of a tool that provides a web-based graphical
    user interface (GUI) to perform a review of the scientific literature under the Bayesian
    approach of latent Dirichlet allocation and machine learning algorithms. The application methodology 
    is framed by the well known procedures in topic modelling on how to clean and process data.
